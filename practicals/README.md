# DAMS Practicals

This repository contains all of the material needed for the DAMS practicals.

You will find that the [DAMS Flippd VLE](http://dams.flippd.it) provides links to the practicals from the relevant videos. You can work through the practicals in the order suggested on the DAMS Flippd VLE, or in another order if your prefer (Do have a chat with me if you'd like advice). You should complete all of the practicals as each one prepares you -- in some way or other -- for the summative assessment.

You should aim to complete the [Ruby](fundamentals/ruby/1_introduction.md) and [Vagrant](fundamentals/tools/vagrant.md) practicals first, as these are needed in almost every subsequent practical. Once you have completed these practicals, follow the steps below to setup your machine for the remaining DAMS practicals:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/york-cs-dams/practicals.git dams-practicals`
2. Change directory: `cd dams-practicals`
3. Start the DAMS Practicals virtual machine: `vagrant up`
