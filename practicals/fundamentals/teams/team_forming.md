# Team Forming

Throughout DAMS, you will most often work together with your team. The purpose of this tutorial is for you to better get to know your teammates. There is intentionally very little design or maintenance; plenty of that to follow later in the term!

## Meet and greet
Find a member of your team that you don't know very well (if at all). Your goal is to interview each other to find out the following information:

* name (e.g., Louis)
* a few things that you like (Tottenham Hotspur, Northumberland and CoffeeScript)
* a few things that you dislike (Cristiano Ronaldo, mustard and JavaScript)

Produce a "business card" with an illustration of your interviewee, their name, and their likes and dislikes.

(If your team has an odd number of members, form pairs and a trio).

## Class introduction
I will ask you to briefly present your teammate and their business card to the rest of the class.
